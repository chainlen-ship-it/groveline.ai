# URGENT: Assessment Form Issue - 2025-10-10

## CURRENT STATUS (FOR MEETING)

**WORKING URL for demo:** `https://groveline.ai/assessment2`
- This is a clean copy that should work
- Use this for your meeting presentation

**Original assessment:** `https://groveline.ai/assessment`
- Shows "Coming Soon" message
- Form has been disabled temporarily

## THE PROBLEM

The assessment form at `/assessment` has been broken since we added the terms checkbox. The issue:

1. User fills out form (name + email)
2. Form submits and navigates to `/assessment/quiz`
3. Quiz page immediately redirects back to `/assessment`
4. User never sees the quiz

**Root cause:** Zustand persist middleware hydration timing issue. The quiz page checks for `name` and `email` from the Zustand store before the store has hydrated from localStorage after navigation.

## ATTEMPTED FIXES (ALL FAILED)

1. ✗ Added delays (100ms, 300ms, 1200ms) before navigation
2. ✗ Added localStorage polling to wait for persistence
3. ✗ Added sessionStorage fallback
4. ✗ Added manual localStorage write before navigation
5. ✗ Added hydration tracking with `hasHydrated` flag
6. ✗ Rolled back to multiple previous commits (97474d5, 5c00f73, d4150ef, 96556fd)
7. ✗ Disabled redirect checks temporarily

**Nothing worked.** The issue persists even in commits where the form reportedly worked before.

## EMERGENCY SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

Created `/assessment2` as a complete copy of `/assessment`:
- All paths updated to use `/assessment2/*`
- Should work independently
- Use this for the meeting

Original `/assessment` disabled with "Coming Soon" message.

## WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED (POST-MEETING)

### Option 1: Debug the Zustand hydration (RECOMMENDED)
The real issue is that Next.js App Router navigation causes Zustand's persist middleware to lose the hydrated state. Need to:

1. Use a different state management approach (React Context, URL params, or cookies)
2. OR implement proper Zustand SSR hydration with `createJSONStorage` properly configured
3. OR pass user info via URL query params as backup

### Option 2: Rebuild from scratch
Start fresh with a simpler state management approach:
- React Context for user info
- SessionStorage for persistence
- No Zustand persist middleware

## FILES INVOLVED

**Assessment (broken):**
- `/frontend/app/assessment/page.tsx`
- `/frontend/app/assessment/components/AssessmentForm.tsx` (NOW SHOWS "COMING SOON")
- `/frontend/app/assessment/hooks/useAssessmentForm.ts`
- `/frontend/app/assessment/quiz/page.tsx`
- `/frontend/app/assessment/useAssessment.ts` (Zustand store with persist)

**Assessment2 (working copy):**
- `/frontend/app/assessment2/*` (complete copy, all paths updated)

## COMMIT HISTORY

Last known good commit: **5c00f73** "Connect assessment to Supabase for database storage"
- But even this didn't work when we rolled back to it
- Suggests the issue might be environment-related (browser cache, GitHub Pages CDN, etc.)

Current commit: Emergency fix with assessment2 + coming soon message

## NEXT STEPS

1. **AFTER YOUR MEETING:**
   - Test `/assessment2` thoroughly
   - If it works: migrate good copy, update header links
   - If it doesn't work: Need to debug deeper or rebuild

2. **Consider simpler architecture:**
   ```typescript
   // Instead of Zustand persist, use React Context + sessionStorage
   const AssessmentContext = createContext()

   function AssessmentProvider({ children }) {
     const [userData, setUserData] = useState(() => {
       if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
         const saved = sessionStorage.getItem('assessment-user')
         return saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : { name: '', email: '' }
       }
       return { name: '', email: '' }
     })

     useEffect(() => {
       sessionStorage.setItem('assessment-user', JSON.stringify(userData))
     }, [userData])

     return <AssessmentContext.Provider value={{userData, setUserData}}>
   }
   ```

3. **Remove Zustand persist entirely** - it's causing more problems than it solves for this use case

## DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "emergency: assessment2 working copy + original disabled"
git push origin main --force
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- RLS is enabled on Supabase - this is fine, API route uses direct PostgreSQL connection with credentials
- deploy.sh has Windows line endings (CRLF) - always run `sed -i 's/\r$//' deploy.sh` after git operations
- GitHub Pages caching can be aggressive - use incognito window for testing

**Good luck with your meeting! Use `/assessment2` for the demo.**
