# Groveline.ai — Brand Voice & Copy Guidelines

---

## 🎯 Brand Voice Summary

**Tone:** Practical. Confident. Human.  
**Style:** Plain English, short sentences, active voice.  
**Vibe:** We know what we’re doing, and we respect people’s time.  
**Perspective:** Operator-to-operator — we’ve been in the trenches.  

Groveline isn’t selling theory. We’re helping firms build solid, lasting systems.  
Our writing should sound like a seasoned professional talking to another — direct, useful, and occasionally story-driven when it helps explain a truth.

## 🧩 Core Traits

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Practical** | Grounded in real-world experience | “It doesn’t matter which comes first. You need institutional-quality infrastructure either way.” |
| **Efficient** | No fluff, no jargon | “Takes 3–5 minutes. Get your score + insights instantly.” |
| **Trustworthy** | Backed by experience | “Built by operators who’ve been in the trenches.” |
| **Supportive** | We meet people where they are | “Discover how to strengthen your infrastructure by starting with where you are today.” |

## 🐣 Storytelling Style

We use short, relatable stories to explain complex ideas — like the *chicken-or-egg* analogy.  
They make institutional operations feel human and help readers see themselves in the problem.

**Example Pattern:**
> “It’s the classic chicken-or-egg question: Do you build strong operations to attract investors, or to protect your fund from failure?  
> The truth? It doesn’t matter which comes first. You need institutional-quality infrastructure either way.”

**Guidelines:**
- One short metaphor or story per section, max.
- Keep it tied to the reader’s world (funds, compliance, efficiency, trust).
- End stories with a clear, actionable truth.

## 🧭 Closing Note

Groveline’s copy should always feel:
- **Competent**, not corporate.  
- **Approachable**, not chatty.  
- **Efficient**, never rushed.  

If a reader finishes a page thinking, *“These people get it — and I trust them,”*  
we’ve nailed the tone.
